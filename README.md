This app is one side to the start of a community business project I have been developing for three years. This 
current phase "stock it up" list the business owners I have been networking, coaching, collaborating with and 
mentoring over the past ten years. These start-up/black-owned/minority business owner are the many 
reason I will never stop learning and being innovative. 


Updates to come: 

1. About page 
Originally hosted on wix I am now using bootstrap to add it here 
as I am transitioning from wix to my own developments. 
Maybe one day I will play with wordpress. 

2. #TDCW (These Divas Can Write) Awards nomiation
Originated from the FB group of independently published authors. The group creator Tia Barnes, whom I interviewed on my 
podcast approached me before I published my first book to be a creative admin for the group. 
We discussed more than a few things with three other admins and an 
independent author award presentation was born. This page will showcase all of the nominees and the winners of each category.
This was an incredible project. Unfortunately, my travel nursing and Hurricane Harvey was the perfect storm to incompletion. 
Stay tuned for the finally presented results. 

3. Home page:
The final and subsequent updates will always include investor, investing or investment feautures and business sponsors.

Lastly, there is a Ruby on Rails app I will be intergrating as well. Details about that later. :=)

Thank you for your time. All advice, help and guidance welcome.

Sincerely, 

Susie Newton
